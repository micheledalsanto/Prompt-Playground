# ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering Cheatsheet

I put together this cheatsheet to organize what Iâ€™ve learned about prompt engineering through courses, hands-on practice, technical blogs, and community resources like OpenAI, DeepLearning.AI, and Google.  
My goal is to make this a practical reference for anyone who wants to explore, learn, and experiment with promptsâ€”whether you're just starting out or already deep into the world of LLMs.

Feel free to use, remix, or improve anything here.  
And if you have suggestions, ideas, or improvementsâ€”I'd really appreciate hearing them!

## ðŸ”¹ 1. General Prompt Construction

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
To create clear and direct prompts for a wide variety of tasks, ensuring high-quality and relevant outputs.

âœ… **Ideal Use Cases:**

- Content generation (blog posts, summaries, translations)  
- Structured data extraction (from unstructured text)

ðŸ§© **Template**

### Objective  
[Clearly state the task.]

### Context  
[Provide essential background information.]

### Instructions  
[Define specific steps or expectations.]

### Constraints  
[Include any rules: tone, length, output type.]

### Output Format  
[Specify how the answer should be structured.]

### Example  
[Optional: show an example input/output.]

ðŸ§ª **Example**

### Objective  
Summarize the findings of the latest WHO mental health report.

### Context  
The report outlines the global increase in anxiety and depression post-pandemic.

### Instructions  
- Highlight main causes and affected demographics.  
- Include proposed policy recommendations.

### Constraints  
- Max 150 words.  
- Use clear, accessible language.

### Output Format  
- Bullet point summary.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Few-Shot Prompting

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
To train the model with 2â€“5 examples that establish a pattern before giving it a new input.

âœ… **Ideal Use Cases:**

- Data labeling (e.g. sentiment classification, translation)  
- Format mimicking (e.g. resume rewriting, headline creation)

ðŸ§© **Template**

### Task  
[Describe the task.]

### Examples  
Input: [Sample input 1]  
Output: [Sample output 1]

Input: [Sample input 2]  
Output: [Sample output 2]

...

### Now, complete the following:  
Input: [New input]  
Output:

ðŸ§ª **Example**

### Task  
Classify each sentence as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL sentiment.

Input: I love this product!  
Output: POSITIVE

Input: Itâ€™s okay, not great.  
Output: NEUTRAL

Input: Terrible customer service.  
Output: NEGATIVE

### Now, complete the following:  
Input: The movie was better than I expected.  
Output:

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
To guide the model in producing multi-step reasoning by explicitly showing how to think through the problem.

âœ… **Ideal Use Cases:**

- Math word problems  
- Logical decision-making (e.g. legal, business strategy)

ðŸ§© **Template**

### Question  
[Pose a complex or multi-step problem.]

### Instructions  
Explain your reasoning step by step.

### Response  
Let's think step by step.  
1. [...]  
2. [...]  
...  
Final Answer: [...]

ðŸ§ª **Example**

### Question  
If eggs cost $2.50 per dozen, how much would 18 eggs cost?

### Instructions  
Explain your reasoning step by step.

### Response  
Let's think step by step.  
1. A dozen eggs = 12 eggs.  
2. $2.50 / 12 = $0.208 per egg.  
3. 18 Ã— $0.208 = $3.75.  
Final Answer: $3.75

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Multimodal Prompting (Text-to-Image)

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
To generate or manipulate images based on detailed textual instructions.

âœ… **Ideal Use Cases:**

- Creative visuals for branding or media  
- UI/UX mockup generation for design teams

ðŸ§© **Template**

### Description  
[What is the scene, object, or idea?]

### Style  
[Artistic direction: photo, sketch, digital art, oil painting, etc.]

### Colors  
[Preferred color palette.]

### Lighting  
[Natural, neon, moody, etc.]

### Composition  
[How elements are arranged.]

### Additional Details  
[Any specific textures, expressions, environments.]

ðŸ§ª **Example**

### Description  
A futuristic library floating in space.

### Style  
Digital art with sci-fi influence.

### Colors  
Black, blue, silver with hints of orange glow.

### Lighting  
Soft ambient lighting with glowing book edges.

### Composition  
Wide-angle view with book orbs orbiting a central core.

### Additional Details  
Include a human silhouette reading a holographic book.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Comparative Prompting (A/B Testing)

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
To test how slight differences in phrasing, structure, or context affect the model's output.

âœ… **Ideal Use Cases:**

- UX writing and conversion testing  
- Evaluating LLM performance (e.g. GPT vs Gemini)

ðŸ§© **Template**

### Task  
[Describe the intended task.]

### Prompt A  
[First variation of prompt.]

### Prompt B  
[Second variation of prompt.]

### Evaluation Criteria  
- Accuracy  
- Creativity  
- Clarity  
- Factual consistency

### Output A:  
[...]

### Output B:  
[...]

ðŸ§ª **Example**

### Task  
Write a short bio for a UX designer with 5 years of experience.

### Prompt A  
"Write a professional 2-line LinkedIn bio for a UX designer with 5 years of experience in fintech."

### Prompt B  
"Summarize the professional journey of a fintech UX designer with 5 years of experience in 2 impactful lines."

### Evaluation Criteria  
- Clarity  
- Tone  
- Industry-specific relevance

### Output A:  
"Experienced UX Designer specializing in fintech, with a passion for intuitive product experiences and cross-functional collaboration."

### Output B:  
"Crafting fintech user journeys for 5+ yearsâ€”designing products that merge usability, trust, and innovation."

## ðŸ“Œ Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

- **Start with clear objectives:** Know exactly what you want the model to do.  
- **Give sufficient context:** More detail usually means more relevant output.  
- **Be explicit about constraints:** Include length, tone, format, style, etc.  
- **Use examples generously:** Especially with few-shot or structured tasks.  
- **Iterate and refine:** Prompting is experimentalâ€”test different setups.  
- **Adapt to the model:** Prompt length/style may vary across GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
