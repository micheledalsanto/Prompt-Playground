# 🧪 Prompt Engineering Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on projects focused on Prompt Engineering!

This space contains practical experiments, templates, exercises, and personal tools I’ve built while studying the art of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

Whether they come from structured courses or self-driven exploration, every project here is made with one goal in mind: **to practice, test, and learn how to communicate better with AI**.

## 🔍 What's Inside?

- 🧠 **Prompt templates** for various use cases (content creation, classification, transformation, etc.)
- 🧰 **Reusable structures** to guide LLMs step-by-step
- ✍️ **Style experiments** to analyze tone, format, and output control
- 📂 Each folder contains: prompt instructions, examples, output, and annotations

These aren't just theory — they're built, tested, and refined to solve real challenges and creative tasks.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Prompt Engineering is becoming a key skill in modern AI workflows — from coding to marketing, UX to education.

These projects help me:
- Build better intuition for prompt structure and logic
- Document what works (and what doesn’t)
- Create a portfolio of working examples I can iterate on or reuse
