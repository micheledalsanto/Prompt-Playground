# 📢 Branded Social Prompting

This project explores how to use prompt engineering to generate creative and platform-optimized social media content for a product or brand.

The goal is to practice **stylistic variation**, **audience targeting**, and **output formatting** using structured prompts.  
By comparing the results of different language models, this exercise also builds intuition about which tools best match specific communication goals.

## 🎯 Project Overview

You will write a **custom prompt** to generate 3 distinct social media posts promoting the same product.  
Each post will differ in:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Audience** (e.g. Gen Z, families, professionals)  
- 🎙️ **Tone** (e.g. playful, emotional, minimalist)  
- 📱 **Platform** (e.g. Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook)

For each version, you'll test the prompt with **ChatGPT-4o**, **Gemini**, and **Claude**, and compare the results across creativity, clarity, tone match, and format.
