# 🔁 Prompt Evaluation & Iteration Loop

This folder contains a weekend project designed to practice the **evaluation and refinement** of AI-generated content through a structured prompt engineering process.

The goal is to simulate a real-world loop where:
1. A base prompt is executed
2. The outputs are evaluated using an evaluation prompt
3. A refinement prompt generates an improved version of the original prompt

## 🧠 What This Is About

Many AI use cases require **not just generation, but iteration**. This project helps develop:
- A critical eye for output quality
- Prompts that ask the model to self-analyze or compare alternatives
- Skills to optimize prompts for clarity, tone, structure, and results

## 🧪 Project Structure

Each experiment follows this structure:
- 🎯 **Prompt V1** – The original prompt used to generate content
- 🤖 **Model Outputs** – Responses from ChatGPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude
- 📝 **Evaluation Prompt** – A prompt asking the models to assess the quality of the outputs
- 📊 **Evaluation Table** – A markdown table to compare clarity, completeness, tone, and accuracy
- 🔄 **Prompt Refinement Prompt** – A meta-prompt asking the AI to rewrite the original prompt based on weaknesses found
- ✅ **Final Notes** – A brief reflection on what improved and which model was most helpful

## ⚒️ What You Can Learn

- How different models interpret vague vs. specific instructions
- How to design effective evaluation prompts
- How to craft refinement prompts that produce more effective instructions
- When to adjust prompt structure, tone, or context for better results

## ✍️ Suggested Use Cases

- Blog post generators  
- Marketing email writers  
- Social media caption tools  
- Microcopy assistants  
- Q&A or customer support generation
