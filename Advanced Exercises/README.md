# üß† Advanced Exercises

In this folder I'm experimenting with more advanced prompt techniques like role prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought reasoning. For each prompt, I include the response generated by ChatGPT-4o along with a short evaluation of how well the technique worked.

### üìù To Myself

As I go through these advanced exercises, I want to remind myself what each prompting technique is really about:

- **Role Prompting**: I ask the model to take on a specific role (like a historian, psychologist, or personal trainer) so that its responses reflect that perspective. This helps me shape the tone, language, and context of the answers in a more controlled and realistic way.  
  _Example:_ ‚ÄúYou are a sports psychologist. Explain how athletes can mentally prepare for high-pressure competitions.‚Äù

- **Few-Shot Prompting**: I give the model 2‚Äì3 examples of how I want it to behave before asking it to generate something new. This technique helps set a clear pattern for the model to follow, and I can tweak the examples to guide the tone, format, or logic of the output.  
  _Example:_  
  ‚ÄúCategorize the following movie reviews as Positive or Negative:  
  - 'This movie was a total mess. I want my time back.' ‚Üí Negative  
  - 'A beautiful story, well told. I cried at the end.' ‚Üí Positive  
  - 'The pacing was strange, but I liked the characters.' ‚Üí‚Äù

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: I explicitly tell the model to explain its reasoning step by step. This is useful for tasks that require logic, analysis, or decisions, and it helps me understand how the model arrives at its conclusions.  
  _Example:_ ‚ÄúIf today is Wednesday and a package takes 4 business days to arrive, on what day will it be delivered? Show your steps.‚Äù

By practicing all three, I'm learning how to write better prompts and gain more control over the responses I get.
