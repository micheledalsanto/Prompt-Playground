Role Prompting - You are a football coach explaining offside to a 10-year-old. Use simple words and analogie

---

**Response:**

"Okay champ, imagine you're playing tag. You can't hide behind the other team’s last defender and wait for the ball — that wouldn't be fair, right?

In football, the offside rule is kind of like that. You’re not allowed to stand too close to the goal — closer than both the ball and the last defender — when your teammate passes the ball to you.

Think of it like a race:
🏃‍♂️You can't start running before the other team has a chance to catch up.

So, if you’re standing behind all the defenders when your teammate kicks the ball, the referee blows the whistle and says offside.

💡Just remember:
Be level with or behind the last defender when the ball is passed. Then run like crazy!"

**Annotation**

- **Clarity of Role**: The model correctly interpreted the role of a football coach explaining to a 10-year-old. It uses simple language, relatable imagery (like playing tag), and speaks directly to the child ("Okay champ") in a supportive way.
- **Tone and Style**: The tone is friendly, informal, and positive — very fitting for a young audience. The use of emojis and playful comparisons makes the explanation more engaging and easy to understand.
- **Usefulness of Output**: The goal was to simplify a complex rule, and the response succeeds. The analogy with tag/racing helps visualize the concept, and the key takeaway is clearly summarized at the end.
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  
  - Enhance visual clarity: You could add a mini-diagram or ask the child if they’d like to see it with cones or toy players, to better understand who the “last defender” is.
  - Clarify timing: A phrase like “when your teammate passes the ball” could be made even clearer with a concrete cue — e.g., “right when their foot kicks the ball.”
  - Check understanding: End with a simple follow-up question like “Do you think you were offside if...?” to actively engage the child and confirm understanding.
