## üßµ Chain-of-Thought Prompting Exercise ‚Äì ‚ÄúTrain Time Calculation‚Äù

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt Instruction:**

A train leaves at 3:15 PM and arrives at 4:45 PM. How long is the trip? Show your steps.

---

**Response:**

Step 1: Break the time into parts

- Start time: 3:15 PM
- End time: 4:45 PM

We can break this into two parts:

- From 3:15 PM to 4:15 PM = 1 hour
- From 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM = 30 minutes

Step 2: Add the parts together

1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes
**‚úÖ Final Answer: The trip is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.**

**Annotation**

- **Logical Clarity:** The model clearly broke the time range into logical parts: hour by hour, then the remaining minutes. The use of bullet points made the steps easy to follow.

- **Correctness:** The final answer of **1 hour and 30 minutes** is correct based on the time given. The calculation was done in two distinct, correct steps.

- **Depth of Reasoning:** While the task is simple, the model handled it thoroughly by showing intermediate steps rather than jumping to the answer. It didn't overcomplicate the explanation, which is appropriate for the prompt.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**
  - Add a follow-up prompt that involves crossing **AM to PM**, e.g., "The train leaves at 11:50 AM and arrives at 1:20 PM."
  - Add a version that asks for the duration **in minutes only**, to test if the model can convert time accurately (e.g., 90 minutes).
  - Consider including an **error case** (e.g., incorrect AM/PM conversion) to evaluate the model's robustness.
