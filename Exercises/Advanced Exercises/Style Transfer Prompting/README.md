# 🎨 Style Transfer Prompting

This folder contains practical exercises designed to help you explore and master **style transfer prompting** — the ability to modify the tone, voice, and language of AI-generated outputs to match different contexts, audiences, or personas.

Each exercise follows the same structure: a neutral base prompt, an output style requirement, and specific instructions to shape the transformation. These tasks are ideal for creative roles such as copywriters, brand strategists, and social media managers.

## 📘 How to Use

Each exercise file includes:

- A **Base Prompt**: a neutral sentence or message.
- A **Target Style**: the new tone or voice to apply.
- Clear **Instructions**: what to keep, change, and emphasize.
- A section for testing with multiple models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
- A structured space for output comparison and improvement notes.

You can duplicate the included template file to create your own exercises.
