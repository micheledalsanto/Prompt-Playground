# 📄 Prompting Output Format Testing

This folder is dedicated to testing how **output formatting** can be controlled through prompting.

Rather than focusing on what the model says, these exercises explore **how the information is presented** — using lists, tables, markdown, FAQs, or other structured formats. I want to learn how to make responses clearer, more readable, and directly usable.

Each exercise includes:

- A prompt with explicit formatting instructions
- The formatted output generated by ChatGPT-4o
- A short evaluation on clarity, structure, and correctness

## 🎯 Output Types Tested

- **Bullet Lists & Numbered Lists**  
  Useful for summarizing or outlining content.  
  _Example:_ “List 5 advantages of using AI in education. Use bullet points.”

- **Markdown Formatting**  
  Ideal for blog posts, documentation, and GitHub-friendly content.  
  _Example:_ “Summarize the importance of healthy sleep in markdown with headings and bold text.”

- **Tables**  
  Great for comparison, data analysis, or structured summaries.  
  _Example:_ “Generate a markdown table comparing GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini across four dimensions.”

- **FAQ / Q&A Style**  
  Effective for tutorials, help sections, and chat-based interfaces.  
  _Example:_ “Write 5 FAQs about applying for a student visa in Italy. Bold each question.”

By mastering these output styles, I improve my ability to prompt for responses that are not just correct — but also **presented in a professional and useful way**.
