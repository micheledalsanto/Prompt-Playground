## 🔧 Improvements to the Prompt

To increase clarity and control, the following changes are recommended:

- ✅ **Clarify formatting expectations**  
  Ask explicitly for:

  - Introduction and Conclusion as separate sections (not numbered)
  - Only the three core sections to be numbered (1, 2, 3)

- ✅ **Define tone and target audience**  
  Specify if the outline is for a technical blog, general audience, or marketing professionals.  
  _e.g._ “Use a professional but engaging tone suitable for B2B marketers.”

- ✅ **Add constraints or optional elements**  
  Include requests like:

  - Add 1–2 key questions for each section to guide content
  - Suggest a call to action in the conclusion

- ✅ **Example revision of the prompt:**
  > "Create a markdown-formatted blog outline titled 'How AI Is Changing Marketing'.  
  > Structure the output with an **unlisted introduction and conclusion**, and **number only the three main body sections**, each with 2–3 bullet points.  
  > Use a professional tone suitable for a digital marketing blog. Include a suggested CTA in the conclusion."
