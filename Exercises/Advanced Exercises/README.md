# 🧠 Advanced Exercises

In this folder I'm experimenting with more advanced prompt engineering tasks using ChatGPT-4o. These include not only testing **prompting techniques** like role prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought reasoning, but also exploring how different **output formats** affect clarity, usability, and control.

For each prompt, I include:

- A clearly written instruction
- The response generated by **ChatGPT-4o**
- A short evaluation on how well the prompt worked and how effective the output format was

### 📝 To Myself

As I go through these advanced exercises, I want to remind myself what each technique and format is really about:

---

#### **Prompting Techniques**

- **Role Prompting**  
  I ask the model to take on a specific role (like a historian, psychologist, or personal trainer) so that its responses reflect that perspective. This helps me shape tone, language, and context in a more controlled way.  
  _Example:_ “You are a sports psychologist. Explain how athletes can mentally prepare for high-pressure competitions.”

- **Few-Shot Prompting**  
  I give the model 2–3 examples of how I want it to behave before asking it to generate something new. This sets a clear pattern the model can replicate.  
  _Example:_  
  “Categorize the following movie reviews as Positive or Negative:

  - 'This movie was a total mess. I want my time back.' → Negative
  - 'A beautiful story, well told. I cried at the end.' → Positive
  - 'The pacing was strange, but I liked the characters.' →”

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**  
  I explicitly tell the model to explain its reasoning step by step. This is useful for logic-based tasks or structured decision making.  
  _Example:_ “If today is Wednesday and a package takes 4 business days to arrive, on what day will it be delivered? Show your steps.”

#### **Output Format Testing**

Understanding how to instruct the model to **structure** its output helps me create clearer and more usable responses.

- **Lists & Bullet Points**  
  Prompts that require quick scanning or summarization benefit from bullet formatting.  
  _Example:_ “List 5 benefits of learning prompt engineering, each with a short explanation.”

- **Markdown Formatting**  
  Using markdown in responses is helpful for blog content, documentation, and organized layouts.  
  _Example:_ “Summarize the benefits of sleep with markdown headings, bold keywords, and a final quote.”

- **Tables**  
  Great for comparison and structured analysis.  
  _Example:_ “Create a markdown table comparing GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini with columns for strengths and weaknesses.”

- **FAQs / Q&A**  
  Useful for user guides, help sections, and web-based experiences.  
  _Example:_ “Write 5 frequently asked questions about working remotely, with short, friendly answers.”

By practicing both **prompt techniques** and **output formatting**, I’m learning how to write more effective prompts and guide the model toward clearer, more structured, and context-aware results.
