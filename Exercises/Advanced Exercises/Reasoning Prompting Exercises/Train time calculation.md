Step-by-step answer:  
To find the duration of the train trip from **3:15 PM** to **4:45 PM**, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Break the time interval into parts**

Go from **3:15 PM** to **4:00 PM** first:

* From 3:15 PM to 4:00 PM = **45 minutes**

Then go from **4:00 PM** to **4:45 PM**:

* From 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM = **45 minutes**

**Step 2: Add the two intervals**

* 45 minutes + 45 minutes = **90 minutes**

✅ **Final Answer:**

**The trip is 1 hour and 30 minutes (or 90 minutes) long.**

Step-by-step answer:  
Let's break down the train trip duration:

1.  **From 3:15 PM to 4:00 PM:** That's a jump to the next whole hour. To find this duration, we subtract the minutes: 60 minutes - 15 minutes = 45 minutes.

2.  **From 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM:** This is simply the number of minutes past the hour, which is 45 minutes.

3.  **Total time:** Now, we add the durations from the two steps: 45 minutes + 45 minutes = 90 minutes.

So, the train trip is **90 minutes** long.

We can also express this in hours and minutes: 90 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

To find the duration of the trip, I'll calculate the time difference between the start and end times.

Start time: 3:15 PM
End time: 4:45 PM

Step 1: Convert both times to the same format (hours and minutes).
- 3:15 PM = 3 hours and 15 minutes
- 4:45 PM = 4 hours and 45 minutes

Step 2: Find the difference.
- Hours: 4 - 3 = 1 hour
- Minutes: 45 - 15 = 30 minutes

Step 3: Combine the results.
- Total trip duration = 1 hour and 30 minutes (or 90 minutes)

Therefore, the train trip is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.

## 🛠 Suggestions For Improvement

- Consider adding a clarification in the prompt to avoid redundant breakdowns (e.g., "avoid repeating intervals").  
- Explicitly ask for the **final answer to be clearly stated** after the reasoning.  
- Could add a variant prompt requiring the answer in both minutes and hours.
