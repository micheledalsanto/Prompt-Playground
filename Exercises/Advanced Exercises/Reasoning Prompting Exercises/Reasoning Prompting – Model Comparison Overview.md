# üìä Reasoning Prompting ‚Äì Model Comparison Overview

This document compares how three language models ‚Äî **ChatGPT-4o**, **Gemini**, and **Claude** ‚Äî handled multi-step reasoning tasks. The prompts required clarity, logical breakdown, and accurate conclusions across three types of reasoning:

1. Time Calculation (basic logic)
2. Marketing Decision-Making (strategic reasoning)
3. Ethical Trade-offs (moral reasoning)

## ‚úÖ General Observations

- **ChatGPT-4o**  
  Performs consistently well across reasoning types, especially when structure and clarity are important. Strong format control.

- **Gemini**  
  Efficient and concise, but occasionally underdevelops reasoning, especially on moral/ethical tasks. Best for quick insight.

- **Claude**  
  Strong in depth and nuance, particularly in ethically sensitive scenarios. Sometimes overly verbose or loosely formatted.

---

## üí° Prompting Tips (Based on These Results)

- Always **ask for step-by-step reasoning** and **explicit structure** (e.g., bulleted list, pros/cons).
- If clarity is key, request markdown or numbered outputs.
- For ethical questions, encourage framing from **multiple stakeholder perspectives**.
- Use follow-up prompts to refine overly long or vague outputs.

---

## üõ† Suggestions For Improvement

- **ChatGPT-4o:** Sometimes assumes structure is obvious; could benefit from more specific formatting constraints.
- **Gemini:** May need reinforcement to expand on moral/strategic reasoning.
- **Claude:** Excellent insights but should be prompted for conciseness and formatting clarity.
