# 🔎 Reasoning Prompting Exercises

This folder contains exercises focused on testing **multi-step reasoning** and structured thinking using large language models.

The goal is to write prompts that encourage the model to **"think out loud"** — breaking down decisions, solving problems step-by-step, or explaining logical processes.

## 🧪 What’s Inside

Each exercise includes:
- A prompt requesting explicit reasoning or breakdown  
- The model responses from **ChatGPT-4o**, **Gemini**, and **Claude**  
- A comparison table to evaluate clarity, depth, and correctness  
- Notes and suggestions to improve prompt quality
