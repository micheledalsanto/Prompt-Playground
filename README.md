# 🎯 Prompt Playground

**My test workspace to practice prompt writing and optimization.**

This repository documents my journey as I learn and practice the fundamentals of Prompt Engineering. The goal is to explore how different prompt styles influence the quality, precision, and creativity of outputs generated by large language models such as ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Claude.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🧪 Base Exercises
At the moment I'm focusing on basic prompt writing techniques.

In this folder, you will find:
- 📝 Prompt examples written in **two versions**:
  - **Generic:** standard or simple prompt
  - **Optimized:** improved for clarity, context, or control
- 💬 The **responses generated by ChatGPT-4o** for each version
- ✅ A brief evaluation or comment on how the output changes between versions

This hands-on practice helps me better understand how language models interpret and react to different instructions.

### 🧠 Advanced Exercises

This folder contains prompt writing experiments using more advanced techniques, such as:

- 🎭 Role prompting – assigning a specific persona to the model
- 🧠 Few-shot prompting – guiding the output with clear examples
- 🧵 Chain-of-thought prompting – encouraging step-by-step reasoning

Each file includes:

- Carefully designed prompts
- Responses from ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Claude (atleast 1 of them)
- Evaluations on effectiveness, clarity, and control
- Notes on how small changes impact the output

These exercises aim to explore deeper control and precision in prompt engineering beyond basic use cases.

### 🧪 Projects

This folder includes mini-projects that apply prompt engineering to solve real-world or creative tasks using ChatGPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude.

Each project is designed to:

- Apply prompt strategies (role-based, chain-of-thought, constraint-driven, etc.)
- Showcase multi-model comparisons
- Test prompt transferability and output consistency
- Simulate realistic workflows (e.g. marketing tasks, data extraction, UX writing, etc.)

Project folders typically contain:

- Prompt design documentation
- Prompt variants and iterations
- Model outputs and comparative analysis
- Optional: Markdown reports or conclusions

These projects aim to bridge the gap between theoretical prompt design and practical application.

## 📌 Goals

- Improve my ability to write clear, task-specific prompts
- Understand and document best practices for prompt design
- Build a small public portfolio of experiments as a Prompt Engineering learner
