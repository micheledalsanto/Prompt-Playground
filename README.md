# 🎯 Prompt Playground

**My test workspace to practice prompt writing and optimization.**

This repository documents my journey as I learn and practice the fundamentals of Prompt Engineering. The goal is to explore how different prompt styles influence the quality, precision, and creativity of outputs generated by large language models such as ChatGPT-4o.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🧪 Base Exercises
At the moment I'm focusing on basic prompt writing techniques.

In this folder, you will find:
- 📝 Prompt examples written in **two versions**:
  - **Generic:** standard or simple prompt
  - **Optimized:** improved for clarity, context, or control
- 💬 The **responses generated by ChatGPT-4o** for each version
- ✅ A brief evaluation or comment on how the output changes between versions

This hands-on practice helps me better understand how language models interpret and react to different instructions.
