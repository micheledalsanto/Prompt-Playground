My test workspace to practice prompt writing and optimization

# üß™ Prompt Engineering ‚Äì Base Exercise

At the moment im practicing AI Prompt writing with some examples generated by ChatGPT.
Below I will list some examples of prompts I am working on in two versions, generic and optimized.
For each example I will also annotate the answer given by **ChatGPT 4o**.

## ‚ÄúCreate a professional summary of up to 100 words for LinkedIn.‚Äù

**Generic:** 

Create a professional summary of up to 100 words for LinkedIn of this article: https://medium.com/@tejpal.abhyuday/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-basics-to-advanced-a2b068fd576c

**Response:**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by integrating external knowledge, addressing challenges like the "Lost in the Middle" issue in large documents. By indexing document paragraphs and retrieving relevant segments, RAG feeds precise context into models like GPT-4, improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, enabling domain-specific applications such as intelligent search engines and virtual assistants. RAG's architecture, combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models, ensures efficient and contextually relevant outputs, making it a valuable tool in AI-driven information processing.

Take this article from Medium https://medium.com/@tejpal.abhyuday/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-basics-to-advanced-a2b068fd576c
Imagine you are a Social Media Specialist, you have to write me a very professional and well detailed article that manages to describe the content of the text in 100 words. The summary will then be used for a Linkedin page of a tech company that wants to disseminate information about the topic to its followers, who are often techies themselves.
Use diagrams and examples if possible. 
List use cases such as ‚Äúyou can use it here‚Äù
The output should be simple text.
Also create me an eye-catching but professional image to use in the post.

üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by integrating them with external data retrieval. Rather than relying solely on stored knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant content from indexed sources to generate grounded, context-aware responses.

üìò Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Real-time customer chatbots
‚Ä¢ Intelligent search engines
‚Ä¢ Legal or medical assistants

üìä Flow: Query ‚Üí Retrieval ‚Üí Augmentation ‚Üí Response

This makes RAG ideal for applications that demand high reliability, accuracy, and up-to-date information‚Äîwithout retraining the model.

**Annotation**

The response was the result of some clarifications on my part. Initially, in fact, he had not written the text to me in English and had not complied with the 100-word limit.
To remedy this I should therefore have reinforced the instructions by putting them at the end of the prompt as well, perhaps using a list of key points such as:

- MUST be in English
- MUST NOT exceed 100 words
