# 👨‍💻 The role of a Prompt Engineer

A **Prompt Engineer** is someone who specializes in designing effective prompts to communicate with AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Their goal is to get the **best possible output** from the AI by carefully crafting instructions.

Think of them as translators between **human needs** and **AI language**.

## 🧩 What Does a Prompt Engineer Do?

- ✍️ **Writes prompts** to guide AI responses for specific tasks (e.g., writing, analysis, design)
- 🔁 **Tests and improves** prompts through multiple iterations
- 🧠 **Understands the model’s behavior** to predict how it will respond
- 📄 **Documents prompt templates** for use by teams (e.g., marketing, HR, customer support)
- 🤝 **Collaborates with designers, product managers, developers** to integrate AI into tools and workflows

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Prompt Engineers often work with:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like:
  - ChatGPT (OpenAI)
  - Claude (Anthropic)
  - Gemini (Google)
  - Mistral, Cohere, Llama (Meta), etc.

- **Platforms & APIs**:
  - OpenAI API (via Python, Node.js, or low-code tools)
  - LangChain, LlamaIndex (for building AI agents and apps)
  - Notion AI, Zapier, Retool, Bubble (for non-coders)

- **Tools for testing prompts**:
  - Prompt testing dashboards
  - Custom evaluation scripts
  - AI sandbox tools like PromptLayer or FlowGPT
