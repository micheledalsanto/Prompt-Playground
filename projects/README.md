# 📣 Adaptive Social Post Generator – Prompt Template

This is a reusable prompt template designed for content creators, marketers, and social media managers who want AI to write posts that **match their personal tone and style** — not generic, robotic content.

## 🚀 What It Does

It turns ChatGPT (or any LLM) into a guided social media assistant. Instead of jumping straight into writing, the AI will first:
- Ask for your page (via link or direct info)
- Understand your tone, audience, and communication goals
- Analyze past posts you’ve written
- Ask a few focused questions
- Then generate content that sounds like you
